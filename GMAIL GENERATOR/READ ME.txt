Welcome to "Gmail Generator" created by: 9socket

-PURPOSE:

The purpose of this script is to create possible email combinations for burner accounts.
Burner meaning, it should NOT be used as a main account and should not be used for anything important.
This is an opensource script, so feel free to change the code however you like.
The code may be pretty messy, as I'm generally new to python at the time this was created.


-DISCLAMER

These accounts can be very insecure. As there is a randomly generated password, creating your own is reccomended.
Some of these email usernames may be taken also. This is not a checker, just a generator for possible combinations.
A phone number and gender will have to be provided by the user, even though they are both optional.

(I don't work with or associate with Google in any way.)


note: Once you start generating accounts, it will activate a loop and wont stop, unless it's by the user.
